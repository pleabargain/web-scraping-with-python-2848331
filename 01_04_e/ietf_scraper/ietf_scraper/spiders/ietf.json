This specification is primarily\n useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not\n recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\n Overview and Rational\n\n Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low\n altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single\n point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,\n but many carriers can be used without significant interference with\n each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether\n space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by\n IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance\n system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network\n technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to\n line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in\n some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.\n\n Frame Format\n\n The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in\n hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.\n The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.\n A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The\n bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and\n paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A\n typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.\n\n Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the\n datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable\n form.\n\n Discussion\n\n Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking\n order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and\n eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss\n of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-\n regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause\n data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier\n drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be\n found on logs and cable trays.\n\n Security Considerations\n\n Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special\n measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers\n are used in a tactical environment.\n", "headings": ["Status of this Memo", "Overview and Rational", "Frame Format", "Discussion", "Security Considerations"]}
